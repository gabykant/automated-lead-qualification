# Project Overview

## 🧠 Lead Qualification Automation (n8n)

**Automated lead qualification and routing using n8n (self-hosted).**

This project demonstrates how to build a complete business automation workflow that:

- receives leads via HTTP webhook
- normalizes incoming data
- applies rule-based lead scoring
- automatically routes leads based on priority
- sends notifications and responses

## 🚀 Use Case

Companies often receive many leads but lack an automated way to prioritize them.

This workflow automatically evaluates each lead based on:

- company size
- budget
- urgency
- keyword analysis

Each lead is classified as **HOT**, **WARM**, or **COLD**, triggering the appropriate action.

- Webhooks (HTTP API)

## 🧩 Scoring Logic (Summary)

| Criteria     | Points |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Company size | 10–30  |
| Budget       | 5–40   |
| Urgency      | 10     |
| Keywords     | 20     |

**Classification:**

- HOT ≥ 70
- WARM 40–69
- COLD < 40
